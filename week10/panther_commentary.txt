Icam2 - INTERCELLULAR ADHESION MOLECULE 2
Probably something related to changing cell-cell adhesion between stages. Maybe related to cell migration too?

Naga - N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE-6-PHOSPHATE DEACETYLASE (PTHR11113:SF14) or Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase
Both of these are sugar hydrolases. They're probably involved in a metabolic change associated with shifting to a different cell type.

Spry4 - Protein sprouty homolog 4
Has MAP kinase activity and is involved in signal transduction. Most likely helps relay signals for differentiation.

Osr2 - Protein odd-skipped-related 2
Transcription factor, regulates RNA Pol II transcription. Probably helps induce/suppress genes required for differentiation.
