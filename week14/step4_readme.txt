Here are the reasons why I labeled clusters the way I did. The numbers correspond to cluster numbers
in the original, unannotated t-SNE plot.

0
1 - SST interneurons: Express Gad1, meaning that they're GABAergic interneurons. This is the only cluster that has Sst and Lhx6 expression, so I guessed that they're the SST subset of the GABAergic interneurons
2
3
4
5
6
7 - Radial glia 1: Express Hes1 and Pax6
8
9
10 - Radial glia 2: Also express Hes1 and Pax6
11
12
13
14 - VIP interneurons: Express Htr3a
15
16
17 - PV interneurons: Express Gad1, meaning that they're GABAergic interneurons. This is the only Gad1 cluster that doesn't correlate with Sst or Htr3a so I guessed that it was the third group of GABAergic interneurons
18
19 - Oligodendrocytes: Express Sox17
20
21
22 - Glial cells: Express Hcls1
